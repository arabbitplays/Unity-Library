# Unity-Library

A collection of scripts used commonly in my Unity game development.

- Animation Utilities
- Audiomanager for playing sounds with individual volume and pitch 
- Event system for an versatile observer pattern
- Pooling system for object pooling
- Basic shooting system for quick prototyping
- Wrapper scripts to easily switch between scriptable objects and simple values for variables
    - for floats
    - for layermasks
- Flexible grid layout, a UI component that is a more flexible variant of the grid layout group
- Other simple utility scripts
- Some shaders I played with based on tutorials from [catlikecoding](https://catlikecoding.com/)
